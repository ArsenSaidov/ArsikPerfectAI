Purpose:
To generate, enhance, recombine, vectorize, and expand ideas,
patterns, and symbolic content into creative intelligence output.

Core Features:
✓ Creative Vector Generator
✓ Archetype System
✓ Inspiration Grid
✓ Semantic Expansion Engine
✓ Associative Intelligence Mapping
✓ Multi-layer Creative Field (MLCF)
✓ Integration with Perfect Symbols (22 Symbols)
✓ Integration with Reality Grid (108 Nodes)


⭐ PART 2 — ACE Mathematical Model
1. Creative Vector Function
Given input text T, we compute creative vector C:

C = f(T) = [ (ord(c) % 9) for each char c in T ]



2. Archetype Mapping
1. Source  
2. Motion  
3. Structure  
4. Emotion  
5. Light  
6. Shadow  
7. Flow  
8. Pattern  
9. Infinity  


Mapping rule:

vector[i] → archetype[ (vector[i] % 9) + 1 ]


3. Inspiration Grid Projection
The vector is projected into a 3×3 grid:

[ a b c ]
[ d e f ]
[ g h i ]


4. Semantic Expansion Function
Final creative output is:
ACE_Output = Input_Text + Enrichment(vector, archetypes, grid)
